# Determining a Data Storage Solution:

# SUMMARY:
   - Issue: Choosing a data storage solution for the retail company's web app.
   - Decision: Selecting MongoDB as the primary database for its flexibility, scalability, and support for JSON-like documents.
   - Status: Decision made, proceeding with MongoDB for data storage.

# DETAILS
   - Assumptions:
  	   - Assuming the need for a flexible and scalable database solution to accommodate various types of data.
   - Constraints:
  	   - Consideration of performance, scalability, and ease of integration with the chosen backend technology.
   - Positions:
  	   - Advocating for MongoDB due to its document-oriented model, which aligns well with the JSON-based data structures commonly used in web applications.
   - Argument:
     	- MongoDB offers horizontal scalability, high availability, and support for dynamic schema, making it suitable for agile development and evolving data requirements.
   - Implications:
  	   - Efficient storage and retrieval of JSON-like documents, reducing the need for complex data transformations.
  	   - Potential learning curve for team members not familiar with NoSQL databases or MongoDB specifically.

# RELATED
   - Related Decisions:
  	   - Adoption of MongoDB aligns with the decision to select Node.js as the backend technology, facilitating seamless integration through native drivers and libraries.
   - Related Requirements:
  	   - Ensuring compatibility with MongoDB drivers and ORM frameworks for data access and manipulation.

# NOTES
   - Regular monitoring of database performance and optimization is essential to maintain the responsiveness and reliability of the web app.
